# Preliminary-Results-Writing-Sample

The python file contains all the code used to generate the preliminary results appearing in the writing sample.

The folder 'data download' includes all the sources of data and the code use to create the data sets used by the python script. 

The attention indicator is proprietary data I am not allowed to disclose in this public repository. It is therefore missing.
